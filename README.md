# <PasswordGenerator>

## Description

This week's activity was to modify the starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on the criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and has dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. This application has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
